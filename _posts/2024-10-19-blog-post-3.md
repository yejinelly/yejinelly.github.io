I attended the Society for Research in Psychopathology (SRP) 2024 Annual Meeting held in Montreal, Canada from October 17-20, 2024.

The symposium on "Top-Down Perceptual and Affective Mechanisms of Psychopathology" was particularly interesting. It was great to see cognitive biases examined through various theoretical frameworks together, and to learn about new approaches within the classic top-down and bottom-up perspectives.

One of the highlights was the student-mentor lunch program, which gave me the opportunity to directly discuss research ideas and career paths with senior researchers in the field.

Looking forward to applying these insights to my own research on emotion regulation and mental health! 🧠
