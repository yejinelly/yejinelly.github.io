I attended the Society for Research in Psychopathology (SRP) 2024 Annual Meeting held in Montreal, Canada from October 17-20, 2024.

## Symposium: Top-Down Perceptual and Affective Mechanisms of Psychopathology

One of the highlights was the symposium on "Top-Down Perceptual and Affective Mechanisms of Psychopathology" chaired by Dr. Aprajita Mohanty. The symposium featured fascinating talks on:

- **Threat-Related Top-Down Biases in Perceptual Decision Making in Anxiety** - Dr. Aprajita Mohanty
- **Neural Substrates of Higher-Level Prior Overweighting in Delusions** - Dr. Guillermo Horga
- **Interpretation and Belief Updating: Relation to Symptoms of Depression and Social Anxiety** - Dr. Jutta Joormann
- **Using Language to Facilitate Distanced and Abstract Perspectives when Regulating Emotions** - Dr. Erik Nook

The presentations explored how top-down processes influence perception and affect across different forms of psychopathology, from anxiety to depression to psychotic disorders. It was particularly interesting to see how signal detection theory and drift diffusion models can be applied to understand perceptual biases in anxiety.

## Key Takeaways

The conference provided valuable insights into cutting-edge research on psychopathology, including:
- Computational approaches to understanding mental disorders
- The role of stress and environmental factors in psychopathology
- Novel interventions and treatment approaches
- Methodological advances in digital phenotyping and neuroimaging

Looking forward to applying these insights to my own research on emotion regulation and mental health! 🧠
