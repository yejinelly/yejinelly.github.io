I attended the Society for Research in Psychopathology (SRP) 2024 Annual Meeting held in Montreal, Canada from October 17-20, 2024.

The symposium on "Top-Down Perceptual and Affective Mechanisms of Psychopathology" was particularly memorable. It was fascinating to see how signal detection theory and drift diffusion models can be applied to understand cognitive biases in anxiety - the talks showed how threat-related stimuli can shift both perceptual sensitivity and decision-making processes in different ways.

One of the highlights was the student-mentor lunch program, which gave me the opportunity to directly discuss research ideas and career paths with senior researchers in the field.

Looking forward to applying these insights to my own research on emotion regulation and mental health! 🧠
